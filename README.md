# Quant Topics

This repository is a collection of Journals or Files focused on Quantitative Finance in an effort to learn more about the implementation of programming in the financial world. Feel free to explore the files to either learn more or see how much I know -- up to you. 

If you have any questions you can reach out to me and I'd be happy to discuss.

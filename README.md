# Quant Topics

This repository is a collection of Journals or Files focused on Quantitative Finance in an effort to learn more about the implementation of programming in the financial world. Since this is dedicated to my learning of the subject matter, the majority of these files are renditions of other authors, with some changes here and there depending on my goals for the files. Many of the tutorials and starter code I look at comes from (QuantPy) [https://quantpy.com.au/tutorials/]  and (PyQuant) [https://www.pyquantnews.com/free-python-resources] both of whom are very insightful and provide great tutorials. 

If you have any questions you can reach out to me and I'd be happy to discuss.
